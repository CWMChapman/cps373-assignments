Client-Server Topology:
This time of this topology is roughly 1000 seconds makes sense to me. In this setup, we are trying to get to the center node,
which in this case is the server from clients that are one hop away. The hops, in each case take 1000ms. 
Since we arent worried about router bandwidth, and each message takes the same time, the total run time must be at least 1000 ms.


Ring Topology:
The longest message (which is therefore the time it takes for all messages to be received because we arent worried about router bandwidth)
is from R6 to R7, because it must go all the way around the ring to reach 7 (because of the extremely weighty edge). It must make seven hops, 7*100 = 700 ms, 
so therefore the time must be at least 700ms. Depending on the router's message queue, it takes roughly 800 ms.


Complex Topology:
The longest message takes 2300 ms. This is the message from router 4 to router 5. This means that the total time for the complex topology must be at least 2300 ms, which it is. 
Because of the routers message queue, it takes roughly 2400ms.
